@article{Azimi2015,
abstract = {We propose a nonlinear robust model reference adaptive impedance controller for an active prosthetic leg for transfemoral amputees. We use an adaptive control term to consider the uncertain parameters of the system, and a robust control term so the system trajectories converge to a sliding mode boundary layer and exhibit robustness to variations of ground reaction force (GRF). The boundary layer not only compromises between control chattering and tracking performance, but also bounds the parameter adaptation to prevent unfavorable parameter drift. We also prove the stability of the controller for the robotic system in the case of non-scalar boundary layer trajectories using Lyapunov stability theory and Barbalat's lemma. The acceleration-free regressor form of the system removes the need to measure the joint accelerations, which would otherwise introduce noise in the system. We use particle swarm optimization (PSO) to optimize the design parameters of the controller and the adaptation law. The PSO cost function is comprised of control signal magnitudes and tracking errors. PSO achieves a 8{\%} improvement in the objective function. Finally, we present simulation results to validate the effectiveness of the controller. We achieve good tracking of joint displacements and velocities for both nominal and perturbed values of the system parameters. Variations of ±30{\%} on the system parameters result in an increase of the cost function by only 3{\%}, which confirms the robustness of the controller. INTRODUCTION},

abstract = {Robotic testing can facilitate the development of new concepts, designs and control systems for prosthetic limbs. Human subject test clearances, safety and the lack of repeatability associated with human trials can be reduced or eliminated with automated testing, and test modalities are possible which are dangerous or inconvenient to attempt with patients. This paper describes the development, modeling, parameter estimation and control of a robot capable of reproducing two degree-of-freedom hip motion in the sagittal plane. Hip vertical displacement and thigh angle motion profiles are applied to a transfemoral prosthesis attached to the robot. A treadmill is used as walking surface. Aside from tracking hip motion trajectories, the control system can be used to regulate the contact force between the treadmill and the prosthesis. The paper summarizes the overall development process, with emphasis on the generation of a dynamic model that can be used to design closed-loop motion and force control algorithms.},
